"""Which reads support a thing, one row per thing.

Columns, in order, with no header line:

  name         the isoform, allele group or allele the reads support
  reads        the read names, comma separated in the file and a list on the row

Written by flair transcriptome, quantify, alleles and isoalleles, each with its
own file name.  Headerless, since these files are joined and filtered by id with
shell tools as often as they are read by a program.
