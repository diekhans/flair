"""The counts matrix handed to DRIMSeq, one row per isoform.

Columns, in order:

  irow         a serial number over the rows of this file.  DRIMSeq indexes its
               data frame by the first column and refuses duplicate values, which
               the isoform ids can carry when one isoform appears twice
  gene_id      the gene whose isoforms DRIMSeq compares against each other
  feature_id   the isoform
  <sample>     one integer column per sample, named as in the formula matrix

Written by diffexp into its working directory; not an output anyone reads
directly.
