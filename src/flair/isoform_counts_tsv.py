"""Reads supporting each isoform of a flair transcriptome, one row per isoform.

Columns, in order:

  isoform_id          the isoform
  full_length_reads   reads that run the whole isoform, the ones its support is
                      judged on
  total_reads         every read assigned to it, full length or not

Written per partition as <prefix>.isoform.counts.txt and joined into one file,
whose isoform ids are then renamed to their FLT ids.

Not the same file as the per-sample isoform.counts.txt that count_sam_transcripts
writes, which is one count per isoform; see transcript_counts_tsv.
