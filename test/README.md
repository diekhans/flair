# Testing your flair installation

Prerequisites:
 - GNU make

Normally these test use FLAIR code that is in the tree to test a conda install,
run with `make test use_installed_flair=yes`.

Flair is in your $PATH if you used `conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda flair`.

Then run `make test`.

If this is the first time, make will download some sequences from 
[the UCSC Genome Browser download page](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/)
and store them as test_input/genome.fa.

To test modules and other programs:

```
make test
```

If the diffexp dependencies have been install,
```
make test-diffexpress
```

To run both:

```
make test-all
```

`make` outputs a lot of information. If a test fails, it will stop with an error and not run any additional tests.
Errors look like this:

```
make: *** [makefile:71: test-predict-productivity] Error 2
````

You can usually find more information in the lines preceding the error. If you cannot figure out the problem, please 
[create a ticket](https://github.com/BrooksLabUCSC/flair/issues).



# Hub for examining test cases

A UCSC Browser hub exists in hub/hub.txt to visualized test results.  It
references BAM and bigBed files in the output directory.  These files may 
also be view with IGV

The bigBed based files are not built by default. as they require the UCSC
utilities to be install.  To build them:
```
make test-hub
make hub-check huburl=https://public.gi.ucsc.edu/~you/flair/test/hub/hub.txt
```
