"""Read counts of each allele group, from flair alleles.

Columns, in order:

  phase_set        the phase set the group belongs to
  allele_group     the group, named by the variants it carries
  tumor_counts     reads supporting it in the tumor BAM
  normal_counts    reads supporting it in the normal BAM, with --norm_bam
  somatic          yes when the normal support is below --read_support, so the
                   group looks somatic; written only with --norm_bam

The last two columns exist only when a normal BAM was given, since without one
there is nothing to call somatic against.
