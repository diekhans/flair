"""Where each read's ends fall on the transcript it was assigned to, written by
count_sam_transcripts --output_endpos.

Columns, in order:

  read             the read name
  transcript       the transcript it was assigned to
  start_sj_index   index of the first splice junction the read covers, empty for
                   a single exon transcript, which has none
  start_sj_dist    distance from the read start to that junction
  start_tend_dist  distance from the read start to the transcript start
  end_sj_index     index of the last splice junction the read covers
  end_sj_dist      distance from the read end to that junction
  end_tend_dist    distance from the read end to the transcript end

One row per read, so a transcript appears once per supporting read.  An empty
start_sj_index is how a single exon transcript shows: there is no junction to
measure from, so only the transcript end distances are meaningful.
