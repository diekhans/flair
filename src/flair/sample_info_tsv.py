"""The sample info TSV that flair quantify writes beside a counts matrix.

Columns, in order:

  sample_id    names one counts matrix column
  condition    the condition that sample was assigned in the manifest
  batch        the batch it was assigned

One row per counts column, in the same order as those columns.  The fields are
columns of their own, so they may contain any character.

A counts matrix written before this file existed names each column
sample_condition_batch, the first three manifest fields joined by an underscore.
For such a matrix the fields are recovered from the column name instead, which is
why the manifest documentation forbids underscores in those fields.
