"""Column converters and header handling shared by the flair TSV formats.

A converter is the (parse, format) pair a typeMap entry takes, so a column whose
text holds several values is a list on the row and is joined again on write.
Callers then never split or join a column themselves, and the separator is
stated once, here and in the format that uses it.
